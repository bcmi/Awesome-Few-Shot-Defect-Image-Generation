A curated list of resources including papers, datasets, and relevant links pertaining to few-shot defect image generation.Few-shot defect image generation aims to synthesize diverse and realistic defect images using only a limited number of annotated anomaly samples. It primarily focuses on augmenting data for industrial scenarios to improve downstream tasks such as anomaly detection, localization, and segmentation, despite severe data scarcity.
